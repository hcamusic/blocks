# HCA Blocks

This repo contains the tools to author custom blocks for hcamusic.org. Use this if you want to build blocks with custom styling and components.

## Usage

Install dependencies with `yarn install`.

To start the dev server, run `yarn start` and point your browser to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
Every "Block" is a page created with [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started).

When you're finished authoring, build all the blocks with `yarn build`. The styles and html are located under `blocks/`, copy it into the page and use like normal.
